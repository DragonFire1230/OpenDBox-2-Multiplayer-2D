# OpenDBox-2-Multiplayer-2D
DragonBox 2 Multiplayer in 2D but Open Source

# About project
DragonBox was created in January 2022, and the project was frozen in July 2022.

Then came the severely undone DragonBox 2 at the end of August 2022.

Now, I'm trying to make an open source alternative, all sorts of Melon Playground and so on

# Build from official full source code
Download the source code from releases (/src in the repository contains only assets)

Run Unity no older than 2022.2

Build a project for your processor architecture, and platform (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, PlayStation, and Xbox are not supported, and will NOT work because there is no sensor control)
